## Problem Statement
Customer segmentation is one of the most important parts of a business understanding its audiences and to assess whether business decisions affect different types of customers in different ways, and whether these impacts are ideal.

For effective analysis, we aim to use unsupervised clustering to divide customers into segments to optimize the significance of each customer to the business. Given a dataset of customer data and their spending patterns, it can be challenging to spot inherent groupings without machine learning.

We would also need dimensionality reduction techniques, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), to reduce the complexity of the data while preserving its structure, to obtain valuable insights.
